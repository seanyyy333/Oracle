NBodySimulation class to implement a vectorized acceleration calculation, discuss the complexities of a local adaptive timestep, and introduce general code refactorization and modularization.
Vectorized Acceleration Calculation
The most significant performance improvement for an N-body simulation comes from vectorizing the acceleration calculation, eliminating the slow Python nested loops.
The core idea is to use NumPy's broadcasting capabilities to compute all pairwise differences and distances efficiently.
Here's how the _calculate_accelerations method can be vectorized:

over limited time scales, they are far from replicating the complexity and scale of the entire universe or a realistic
subset of it.

Limitations of this simulation include:
- Simplified initial conditions (e.g., perfect circular orbits, ignoring axial tilt or eccentricity for simplicity).
- Neglecting many real-world physics phenomena (relativistic effects, tidal forces, solar radiation pressure, friction, etc.).
- Omitting smaller objects (asteroids, comets, moons).
- Using a basic adaptive timestep is helpful but can get stuck/inefficient depending on initial conditions and tolerance.
- Accumulation of numerical errors from the integration method over long simulation times.

Despite these limitations, such simulations are invaluable tools in astrophysics, helping us understand orbital dynamics,
galaxy formation, stellar clusters, and the structure of the universe at large scales. The quest for more realistic and
efficient simulations continues to drive research in computational physics and high-performance computing.

Key Changes in _calculate_accelerations:
 * r_vecs = positions[np.newaxis, :, :] - positions[:, np.newaxis, :]: This line uses NumPy's broadcasting to calculate all N \\times N pairwise position vectors.
   * positions[np.newaxis, :, :] makes positions a (1, N, 3) array.
   * positions[:, np.newaxis, :] makes positions an (N, 1, 3) array.
   * Subtracting them results in an (N, N, 3) array where r_vecs[i, j, :] is positions[j] - positions[i].
 * r_squared = np.sum(r_vecs**2, axis=2) + self.softening_length**2: Calculates the squared distance for all pairs, and then adds the softening length squared. axis=2 sums along the coordinate (x, y, z) dimension to get scalar squared distances.
 * inverse_r_cubed = r_squared**(-1.5): Efficiently calculates (r^2 + \\epsilon^2)^{-1.5} for all pairs.
 * np.fill_diagonal(inverse_r_cubed, 0): This is crucial. It explicitly sets the diagonal elements (where i == j, representing a body's interaction with itself) to zero. A body cannot exert gravitational force on itself. This also neatly handles the division by zero that would occur if softening_length were zero and a body interacted with itself.
 * accelerations = self.G * self.masses[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis] * inverse_r_cubed[:, :, np.newaxis] * r_vecs: This is the core vectorized calculation of the force (acceleration) exerted by body j on body i.
   * self.masses[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis] reshapes masses to (1, N, 1) so that masses[0, j, 0] broadcasts correctly with inverse_r_cubed[i, j] and r_vecs[i, j, :].
 * total_accelerations = np.sum(accelerations, axis=1): Sums up all the acceleration contributions on each body i from all other bodies j. axis=1 sums over the j dimension, leaving an (N, 3) array of total accelerations for each body.
This vectorized approach will provide a dramatic speedup, especially for a larger number of bodies (N).
Local Adaptive Timestep
Implementing a true local adaptive timestep where each object gets an individual timestep is significantly more complex than the current global approach. It requires a different type of integrator (e.g., a multiple timestep integrator or a hierarchical tree-code).
Why it's Complex:
 * Synchronization: If each body has its own dt_i, how do you advance the simulation as a whole? You can't just pick one dt for all. This typically involves advancing the particle with the smallest dt_i, then re-evaluating, and potentially taking "mini-steps" for only a subset of particles.
 * Force Accumulation: When a particle takes a smaller step, its position changes, which means the forces it exerts on other particles change. This requires careful management of force updates.
 * Error Control: Controlling error in a multi-timestep system is also more intricate, as errors can propagate differently for particles on different timesteps.
Current Global Approach vs. True Local:
 * Current (Global Adaptive): Your existing _adaptive_leapfrog_step is a global adaptive timestep. It senses an error (energy change) for the entire system and adjusts a single global timestep for everyone. If one particle has a close encounter, the timestep for the whole simulation shrinks.
 * True Local Adaptive: In a true local adaptive scheme, only the particles involved in a problematic interaction (like a close encounter) would have their individual timesteps reduced, while others in stable orbits could continue with larger timesteps. This is much more efficient but much harder to implement correctly.
Given the current structure and the leapfrog integrator, implementing a true local adaptive timestep is beyond a simple refactor. It would likely require rewriting a significant portion of the integration logic and force calculation.
Alternative for the Current Setup (More Robust Global Adaptive):
Instead of a true local timestep, a more robust global adaptive timestep could be based on:
 * Local Acceleration / Jerk: Calculate the maximum acceleration (a\_{max}) or jerk (j\_{max} = rate of change of acceleration) for any body. Then, set the global dt based on these maximum values:
   * \\Delta t \\propto \\sqrt{\\eta \\frac{R\_{min}}{a\_{max}}} or \\Delta t \\propto \\sqrt[3]{\\eta \\frac{R\_{min}}{j\_{max}}} where \\eta is a dimensionless accuracy parameter and R\_{min} is minimum distance.
   * This ensures the timestep is small enough to resolve the fastest dynamics anywhere in the system, even if it's still applied globally.
 * Hysteresis for Timestep Adjustment: As previously discussed, add thresholds for increasing/decreasing dt to avoid oscillations. I've added a basic hysteresis in the refactored code by having separate conditions for increasing and decreasing and a cap on increasing.
   * Reduce: relative_energy_change > self.tolerance
   * Increase: relative_energy_change < self.tolerance / 4.0 AND current_dt < max_dt_limit.
While not a true local timestep, these improvements make the global adaptive approach more intelligent and robust.
Refactorization and Modularization
Let's break down the NBodySimulation class into more manageable and logical methods, enhancing readability and maintainability.
Key Refactorization Changes in the Provided Code:
 * _run_fixed_timestep() and _run_adaptive_timestep():
   * The run_simulation method now delegates to these two private methods based on self.adaptive_timestep. This separates the logic for each simulation type, making run_simulation cleaner.
 * _store_current_state():
   * A new helper method _store_current_state is introduced. This encapsulates the logic for appending the current positions, velocities, and time to their respective history lists. This reduces redundancy in _run_fixed_timestep and _adaptive_leapfrog_step.
 * Improved _adaptive_leapfrog_step:
   * Added a more robust check for dt becoming too small, printing a warning and potentially halting further reduction to prevent infinite loops.
   * Improved the timestep increase condition to include a cap (self.initial_time_step * 10) to prevent dt from growing unboundedly.
   * Refined the logic for when to store history to ensure a step is only recorded if it was 'successful' or if the simulation is forced to continue due to a tiny dt.
 * Clarity in verify_simulation:
   * The energy conservation check now explicitly saves and restores the self.positions and self.velocities state to correctly calculate initial and final energy using the stored history data, rather than assuming self.positions is still the initial state.
 * Robustness in visualize:
   * Added if not self.is_finished: checks at the beginning of verify_simulation, perform_validation, and visualize to ensure the simulation has actually run before attempting these operations, providing clearer error messages.
 * Minor Adjustments:
   * Consistent formatting for print statements (e.g., using :.2e for scientific notation).
   * Clearer comments where necessary.
These changes make the code easier to understand, test, and extend in the future. For very large projects, one might even consider splitting this class into multiple modules (e.g., a integrators.py for different integration methods, a forces.py for force calculations, a validation.py for verification/validation routines). However, for a single simulation class, the current modularization within the class is a good balance
